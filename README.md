# Python Port Scanning

## Objective


The purpose of python port Scanning is to build a simple and  effective port scanner using Python. It is designed to scan a target host for open ports, identify active services, and utilize multithreading for faster performance. The scanner provides a practical way to understand the fundamentals of network reconnaissance and can support ethical hacking tasks during the information-gathering phase of a penetration test.

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- 🔹 **Python Scripting** – Writing efficient, modular code using core libraries like `socket`, `threading`, and `argparse`.
- 🔹 **Network Fundamentals** – Understanding TCP/IP, ports, services, and how port scanning works at a low level.
- 🔹 **Multithreading** – Implementing concurrent scanning to improve performance and reduce scan time.
- 🔹 **Banner Grabbing** – Capturing service responses to identify applications running on open ports.
- 🔹 **Input Validation & Error Handling** – Managing exceptions and ensuring the tool runs reliably on different targets.
- 🔹 **Reconnaissance Techniques** – Gaining practical experience with one of the first steps in ethical hacking and penetration testing.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🐍 **Python 3** – Core programming language used to build the scanner.
- 📡 **Socket Library** – Enables network connections and port communication.
- ⚙️ **Threading Module** – Handles multithreaded scanning to improve performance.
- 🧪 **Argparse Module** – Parses command-line arguments for flexible user input.
- 🖥️ **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – Code editor used for writing and debugging the project.
- 🧪 **Linux Terminal** – Environment for running and testing the script.
- 🌐 **Netcat** – Used for validating the scanner's accuracy.
